üßæ Project Overview
This project explores the historical stock performance of Tesla, Inc. from January 1, 2015, to January 17, 2024, with the goal of building predictive models to estimate future stock prices. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes essential monthly stock metrics such as opening, closing, high, low, and trading volume.

We apply time series analysis and machine learning techniques to understand market behavior, extract trends, and generate future price simulations‚Äîvaluable for investors, analysts, and researchers.

üìä Dataset Details
Source: Kaggle

Time Frame: Jan 2015 ‚Äì Jan 2024

Frequency: Monthly

Total Records: 2,274 rows

Columns:

Date: Monthly record date

Open: Opening price

High: Highest price that month

Low: Lowest price that month

Close: Closing price

Volume: Number of shares traded

This dataset offers a decade-long perspective on Tesla‚Äôs market behavior and serves as a strong foundation for financial forecasting and investment research.

üß† Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
Parsing and formatting dates

Handling missing/null values

Sorting time-series data chronologically

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Trendline plots for Open/Close prices

Correlation matrix for numerical features

Visualization of monthly volume and volatility

Rolling averages and SMA/EMA indicators

3. Feature Engineering
Time-based lag features

Technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, MACD, RSI)

Trend-based flags (bullish/bearish windows)

4. Modeling Approaches
Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

ARIMA for univariate time series forecasting

XGBoost Regressor for boosting performance

5. Evaluation Metrics
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R¬≤ Score
